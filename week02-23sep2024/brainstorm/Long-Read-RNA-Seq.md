## ChatGPT short summary on Long-read RNA sequencing
Long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a technology that captures and sequences full-length RNA molecules, providing a more comprehensive view of transcriptomes. It uses platforms like Oxford Nanopore and PacBio, which can read RNA or cDNA molecules in lengths exceeding 10,000 base pairs. Unlike short-read methods, this technology reduces the need for assembly and can identify complex transcript variants, alternative splicing, and gene fusions. It works by transcribing RNA to cDNA (in some protocols) and then sequencing each molecule directly, providing high-resolution insights into RNA structure and expression.
